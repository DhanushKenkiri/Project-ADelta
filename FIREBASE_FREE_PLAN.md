# Firebase Free Plan (Spark) Configuration

This project has been configured to use only features available in the Firebase free Spark plan.

## Features Available in Spark Plan

The free Spark plan includes:

- **Firebase Authentication**: Full authentication system with email/password and Google sign-in
- **Firebase Hosting**: Host your web application
- **Realtime Database**: Limited to 1GB storage and 100 simultaneous connections
- **Firebase Analytics**: Unlimited reporting on up to 500 distinct events

## Features Removed (Requiring Blaze Plan)

The following features have been removed as they require the pay-as-you-go Blaze plan:

- **Cloud Functions**: Serverless backend functions (removed from firebase.json)
- **Excessive Database Usage**: We've added safeguards in database.rules.json
- **Cloud Storage**: File storage features (storage.rules was deleted)
- **Firestore**: Document database beyond free tier

## Configuration Changes Made

1. Removed Firebase Functions configuration from `firebase.json`
2. Removed Cloud Storage rules (deleted `storage.rules`)
3. Updated database rules to add constraints preventing excessive usage
4. Removed any references to Blaze-required services in application code

## Deploying with the Free Plan

To deploy your application with the free plan:

```bash
npm run build
firebase deploy --only hosting
```

## Monitoring Usage

Be sure to monitor your usage in the Firebase Console to avoid exceeding free limits:

1. Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Select your project
3. Navigate to "Usage and billing" in the left sidebar

## Upgrading to Blaze Plan

If you need to use features that require the Blaze plan, you can upgrade at any time:

1. Go to the Firebase Console
2. Select your project
3. Click on "Upgrade project" in the left sidebar
4. Follow the prompts to upgrade to the Blaze plan

Once upgraded, you can restore the removed features.
